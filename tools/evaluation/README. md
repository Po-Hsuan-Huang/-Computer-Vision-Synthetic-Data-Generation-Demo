#Evaluation

This folder contains all files required to generate hit counts. 

How to use :

1. put the .xml files containing ground-truth bounding boxes into folder **annotations**.

2. put the **test.txt** into folder **ImageSets/Main/**

3. put the **detections.pkl** into folder **detections**

4. run file main_eval.py

Result:

You will get two lists **dic**, **dic_gt** represnting counts of detectoins and counts of ground truths for each category.
